## 📖 Project Overview

In retail and logistics, barcode verification is essential to ensure supply chain efficiency. Conventional verification systems often rely on expensive hardware and strict, inflexible image processing rules.

This project proposes a software-based **Deep Learning Barcode Verification System**. By utilizing a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**, the system "learns" to identify features of good and bad barcodes, offering a cost-effective alternative to dedicated hardware scanners.

### Key Objectives
* Develop a CNN model to classify barcode images.
* Create a synthetic dataset containing both high-quality and degraded barcodes.
* Achieve a classification accuracy surpassing 90%.

## ⚠️ Problem Statement

> "Manual barcode verification is laborious and prone to error, while conventional machine vision systems can be too costly and sensitive to lighting conditions."

This project solves this by providing a reliable software solution that classifies barcodes into two categories:
1.  **Valid/Readable:** High-quality, standard-compliant codes.
2.  **Invalid/Unreadable:** Blurred, noisy, occluded, or printing-error codes.

---

## 🧠 System Architecture

The core of the system is a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. Unlike traditional methods that require manual feature extraction, the CNN automatically identifies features such as edges, spacing, and bar patterns to determine quality.

The workflow involves:
1.  **Data Generation:** Creating synthetic images.
2.  **Preprocessing:** Normalization and resizing.
3.  **Training:** Feature extraction and classification via CNN layers.
4.  **Evaluation:** Testing against the validation set using a Confusion Matrix.

## 📂 Dataset Details

Due to the lack of public datasets for "Good vs. Bad" barcode verification, a **Synthetic Dataset** was generated programmatically:

| Class Label | Description | Generation Method |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Class 0 (Good)** | Valid, Readable Barcodes | Generated using the `python-barcode` library. High resolution, clear edges. |
| **Class 1 (Bad)** | Invalid, Unreadable Barcodes | Generated by applying Gaussian blur, salt-and-pepper noise, and occlusion to Class 0 images. |

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Deep Learning:** TensorFlow / Keras
* **Computer Vision:** OpenCV
* **Data Manipulation:** NumPy
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Metrics:** Scikit-learn
* **Environment:** Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Performance & Results

The model was trained for **10 epochs**, showing steady improvement in accuracy and reduction in loss.

* **Training Accuracy:** ~98.5%
* **Validation Accuracy:** **97.0%**

### Confusion Matrix Analysis

We evaluated the model on a test set to understand False Positives and False Negatives.



| | **Predicted: Good (0)** | **Predicted: Bad (1)** |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **Actual: Good (0)** | **198 (TN)** | 2 (FP) |
| **Actual: Bad (1)** | 10 (FN) | **190 (TP)** |

* **True Negatives (198):** Perfectly identified good barcodes.
* **True Positives (190):** Perfectly identified damaged barcodes.
* **Result:** The system significantly exceeded the 90% accuracy objective.

## 🔮 Future Scope

* **Real-World Deployment:** Implementing the model on edge devices like **Raspberry Pi** for real-time assembly line verification.
* **Mobile Integration:** Developing a mobile app to allow warehouse staff to verify stock quality using smartphone cameras.
* **Format Expansion:** Extending the dataset to support **QR Codes** and **Data Matrix** codes.
